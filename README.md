# Toronto Brewery Directory
This is a tool to keep a log of breweries based in Toronto as well as their beers they offer!

## About The Project
This CMS was created as I am passionate about Toronto craft beers. It uses C#, ASP.NET Model, View, Controller (MVC) architecture pattern as well as Entityframework with code first migrations. 

## Main Features
- This project features a 1-M relationship between Breweries and Beers (One brewery can have many beers but a beer can only have one brewery)
- ASP.NET MVC Architecture Pattern
- Entityframework code first migrations to store information in its database
- Language integrated query (LINQ) used for CRUD
- Image Upload

## Future Addons
Once this directory starts gaining more and more breweries I would like to add a search function to be able to pin point exactly the brewery youre looking for. In addition to this a seperating the breweries based on location would add to the experience because not everyone wants to travel across the city for a cold beer!
